        <h1>About The Owner Of This Website 👀</h1>
        <p>Lemuel Etumnu, but some people know me as Baybee Kaywise,is the creator of the website. Curious about how things work, from the laws of motion to chemical reactions, and always digging deep to really understand rather than just memorizing.

            Cars and driving have always been a big part of life. Started learning to drive at 10, started with a mazda626 didn’t hit the road officially until 13, and over time became pretty skilled and knowledgeable.
            
            Always looking to explore, understand, and grow—whether it’s figuring out how things move or mastering the mechanics of a car.</p>
